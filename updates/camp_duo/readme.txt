Welcome to the Camp Campbell buddy initiative!

Through the convenience of your own home computer and the power of programming, we've dispatched a Camp Counselor and a camper to give you the full experience that Camp Campbell has to offer! And all without even needing to travel out to the campsite!

Your Counselor: David
Your fellow camper: Max

Please enjoy as the two reminisce about their time at Camp Campbell and befriend them in the process!
